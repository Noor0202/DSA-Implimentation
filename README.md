# DSA Implementation Repository

Welcome to the DSA Implementation Repository! This repository contains implementations of various data structures and algorithms in different C languages without using any built in.

## Introduction
This repository serves as a resource for learning and practicing data structures and algorithms. Whether you're a beginner looking to understand fundamental concepts or an experienced developer seeking to brush up on DSA, you'll find a wealth of resources here.

## Directory Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

- **data_structures**: Contains implementations of various data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables.
- **algorithms**: Contains implementations of common algorithms including sorting, searching, graph traversal, dynamic programming, and recursion.
- **tests**: Contains unit tests for the implemented data structures and algorithms.

## Getting Started
To get started, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
2. Explore the implementations and documentation for each data structure and algorithm.
3. Use the provided examples and test cases to understand how to use and validate the implementations.

## Contributing
Contributions to this repository are welcome! Whether it's fixing a bug, optimizing an algorithm, or adding a new implementation, your contributions enrich the learning experience for everyone. Here's how you can contribute:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Make your changes in a new branch.
3. Submit a pull request with a clear description of your changes.
4. Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers and merged if it meets the contribution guidelines.
